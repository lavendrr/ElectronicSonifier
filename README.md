Electronic Sonifier / Electrosonics

Ever since hearing Christina Kubisch’s Electrical Walks, I’ve had an interest in harnessing the potential of sonifying the electronics that surround us in our daily lives. The overarching concept for my instrument, the Electronic Sonifier, is to turn these fascinating, but somewhat strange, sounds we get from using an EMF (electromagnetic field) mic into something usable and manipulable for musical expression. As such, the instrument has three parts - the electronic device/devices generating EM fields, the EMF mic picking up and converting these into an audio signal, and the SuperCollider software responsible for manipulating and playing back the end result. As such, the instrument is deeply flexible and interactive, allowing for the user to make use of any regular electronic device they own, such as their phone, their laptop, a lamp, a TV remote, a gaming console, etc., as part of the instrument. This is encouraged as well, since each device emits a wholly unique and interesting EM field that can be changed by interacting with the device as well, on top of the interactivity afforded by the musical parameters present in SuperCollider.

Whilst working on this project, I developed my own implementation of an AutoTune algorithm in SuperCollider based more around mathematics than computer logic, making it robust enough to run without needing complicated checks and keeping latency low. I also composed a piece for this instrument called Electrosonics and performed it live at Columbia College Chicago.
